Pathstitch is for makers who want **CAD precision without CAD overhead**. Sketch a pattern with snapping and
live dimensions, round corners parametrically, drop in saddle-stitch holes and glue tabs, then export
cut-ready DXF/SVG/PDF. The active Avalonia/.NET port imports OBJ/STL meshes for 3D projection,
triangle-preserving flattening, and mesh distortion checks through OpenGeometry-backed workflows, and imports
STEP through its packaged Python/OCCT geometry worker.

> Repository note: this repo now contains two implementation paths. The original macOS app under
> [`Pathstitch/`](Pathstitch) still uses the Python/OpenCASCADE worker described below. The active Avalonia/.NET
> port under [`src/`](src) uses a managed/OpenGeometry OBJ/STL mesh bridge plus an app-owned Python/OCCT worker
> for STEP. Release builds provision both runtimes from explicit locks and never resolve Node or Python from
> the user's `PATH`; `Occt.NET` is not used. The OpenGeometry WASM package and Node runtime are restored from
> pinned, checksummed archives during build.

## Avalonia/.NET port

The active cross-port lives under [`src/`](src), targets `net10.0`, and publishes self-contained `win-x64` and Apple-silicon `osx-arm64` artifacts.

- **3D kernel**: OpenGeometry-facing OBJ/STL mesh bridge plus a packaged Python/OCCT STEP worker; `Occt.NET` has been removed from the Avalonia project
- **App-owned runtimes**: release verification builds locked `win-x64` and `osx-arm64` Python/OCCT workers; users do not install Python, conda, Node, or npm
- **OpenGeometry runtime**: the build downloads pinned, checksummed OpenGeometry and Node runtime archives; published applications run the bundled worker without a user-installed Node or npm
- **Current native editor slice**: STEP/OBJ/STL import, body combination, origin-plane projection, triangle-preserving separate-piece flattening, projection-based mesh distortion metrics, and DXF preview
- **STEP status**: Avalonia release artifacts include a pinned Python/OCCT worker for B-rep import; missing or invalid packaged runtimes fail with typed diagnostics instead of falling back to a machine-installed Python
- **Build**: `dotnet build PathstitchCross.slnx`
- **Release verification**: run the same auditable Windows/macOS gate documented in [`docs/release-readiness.md`](docs/release-readiness.md); a cross-built artifact is not a native-platform sign-off

## Download

**[⬇ Download the latest release](https://github.com/Mason363/pathstitch/releases/latest)** — grab
`Pathstitch-x.y.z.dmg`, drag it into Applications, and you're running.

- **Requires:** an Apple‑Silicon Mac (M1 or newer) on **macOS 14 (Sonoma)+**.
- **This app is not Apple Notarized:** The app is **ad‑hoc signed, not
  Apple‑notarized** (notarization needs a paid $99/yr Apple Developer ID, which this project doesn't have
  yet), so the very first launch needs a **one‑time** Gatekeeper approval — a 15‑second, two‑click bypass.
  See **[Installing](#installing-the-app)**. After that first approval it opens normally forever. 

Is it safe? Yes, completely. The app is 100% open-source, so the entire source code is public and auditable. The only reason it isn’t officially 'notarized' is because Apple charges a $99/year fee to maintain a developer account, which this free project doesn't have yet.

## What it does

### Draw
Line, circle, rectangle, polygon, text, and an Illustrator‑style **pen** tool, all with point/edge/grid **snapping** and
**on‑creation dimensions** — type a width, `Tab`, type a height, `Enter`, done. No hunting through panels.

### Edit
- **Parametric fillet & chamfer** (G1/G2). Every corner is independent, draggable to size, and stays
  editable forever — it can even grow until adjacent fillets meet. Works on polylines, the corner where two
  separate lines meet, and imported geometry.
- **Trim**, Fusion‑style: hover a segment to see exactly what will be removed, then click — or drag across
  several — to cut at every intersection.
- **Boolean** union / subtract / intersect on closed shapes, and **Explode** to break a compound back into
  its individual edges.
- Move/rotate gizmo, point‑to‑point move, scale, mirror, reflect, duplicate.

### Make
- **Stitch holes & saddle‑stitch patterns** generated along any path, with spacing and corner controls.
- **Offset**, **convert‑lines** (dashed/perforated styles), **fill / hatch** a closed region,
  **patterning** (grid, circular, or along a path), and **paper folding** (crease lines + glue tabs) for
  assembling 3D objects from flat stock.

### Go 3D → 2D
Import `.step` / `.stp`, inspect it in a Three.js viewport, and **unfold developable surfaces into flat
nets** ready for the 2D tools — the thing most pattern tools simply can't do. Drag in several models at once
and they auto‑arrange; take a cross‑section from any plane to sketch against.

### Export & integrate
DXF, SVG, PDF, and PNG export; native `.stch` project files; and **Finder QuickLook previews + thumbnails**
for DXF and STEP — press Space on a file and see the real geometry, not a generic icon. Plus the niceties:
customizable keybinds, light/dark themes, a `⌘K` command palette, and a rearrangeable toolbar.

## Legacy macOS architecture

The section below describes the original SwiftUI implementation under [`Pathstitch/`](Pathstitch), not the
active Avalonia/.NET port.

Pathstitch is a thin, fast SwiftUI front‑end over a persistent Python geometry worker. The UI never blocks on
geometry: every operation is a JSON request streamed to a long‑lived backend process and rendered back.

```
┌──────────────────────────────┐        JSON over stdin/stdout        ┌────────────────────────────┐
│  SwiftUI front-end (macOS)    │  ─────────────────────────────────▶ │  Python engine             │
│  AppState · DxfCanvasView ·   │   PythonBridge ↔ pathstitch_core    │  ezdxf · shapely · numpy   │
│  ThreeDViewport (WKWebView)   │  ◀───────────────────────────────── │  pythonOCC (STEP) ·        │
└──────────────────────────────┘                                      │  matplotlib (PDF/PNG)      │
                                                                       └────────────────────────────┘
```

- **Front‑end** — Swift / SwiftUI (`Pathstitch/Pathstitch`). `PythonBridge.swift` keeps one
  `python -m pathstitch_core.worker` process alive and streams framed JSON to it.
- **Engine** — `pathstitch_core/`: `dxf_ops.py` (2D), `step_ops.py` / `surface_unfold.py` /
  `net_unfold.py` (3D & unfolding), driven by `worker.py`.
- **3D viewport** — `viewport3d.html` (Three.js) inside a `WKWebView`.

For a packaged build, a trimmed copy of the Python environment and the engine are bundled into
`Pathstitch.app/Contents/Resources/`, so the shipped app has no external dependencies.

---

## Build from source

You only need this if you want to develop Pathstitch; users just download the `.dmg`.

### Avalonia/.NET port (active)

Restore NuGet packages and build the solution directly for editor development. This does not require a system Python; the complete release procedure provisions the app-owned STEP runtime as documented in [`docs/release-readiness.md`](docs/release-readiness.md):

```powershell
dotnet build PathstitchCross.slnx
dotnet run --project src/Pathstitch.App/Pathstitch.App.csproj
```

### Legacy macOS app

**Requirements**

| Component | Version | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **macOS** | **14.0 (Sonoma)+** | Developed/tested on macOS 26. |
| **Xcode** | **16+** | Built with Xcode 26.5 / Swift 6.3. |
| **Python** | **3.11** | The geometry backend. |

**Python packages** (`pathstitch_core/requirements.txt` + 3D/raster extras):

```
ezdxf          # DXF read/write + 2D geometry
shapely        # offsets, booleans, polygon ops
numpy          # math
svgwrite       # SVG export
matplotlib     # PDF / PNG raster export
pythonocc-core # STEP import + 3D (OpenCASCADE) — install via conda-forge, not pip
```

**Steps**

```bash
# 1. clone
git clone https://github.com/Mason363/pathstitch.git
cd pathstitch

# 2. backend env (conda recommended for pythonocc-core)
conda create -n pathstitch python=3.11
conda activate pathstitch
conda install -c conda-forge pythonocc-core
pip install -r pathstitch_core/requirements.txt matplotlib

# 3. sanity check the engine
PYTHONPATH=. python pathstitch_core/test_dxf_ops.py   # → "ALL TESTS PASSED SUCCESSFULLY!"
```

When run **from Xcode**, the app falls back to your local interpreter + repo. Set the two fallback paths
once near the top of
[`Pathstitch/Pathstitch/Bridge/PythonBridge.swift`](Pathstitch/Pathstitch/Bridge/PythonBridge.swift):

```swift
"/opt/homebrew/Caskroom/miniconda/base/envs/pathstitch/bin/python"  // your env (echo $CONDA_PREFIX/bin/python)
"/absolute/path/to/this/repo"                                       // this checkout
```

Then open `Pathstitch/Pathstitch.xcodeproj` and ⌘R (or `xcodebuild ... -configuration Debug build`).

---

## Packaging a distributable `.dmg`

One command produces a self‑contained, drag‑to‑install image:

```bash
bash scripts/package_app.sh
# → dist/Pathstitch-1.0.dmg   (~400 MB, self-contained, ad-hoc signed)
```

It builds the Release app, copies a **trimmed** Python env (≈2.8 GB → ≈1.1 GB — OpenCASCADE stays; dev‑only
LLVM/Qt/VTK/headers are dropped) plus `pathstitch_core` into the bundle, ad‑hoc signs it, and creates a
`.dmg` whose window has the app next to an **Applications** shortcut (drag one onto the other). Point it at a
different env with `CONDA_ENV=/path/to/env bash scripts/package_app.sh`.

**Styled installer window.** Drop a `scripts/dmg/background.png` (500 × 500) and the packager builds a
positioned drag‑to‑Applications window over your artwork; without it you get a plain (but still functional)
drag‑install DMG. Use **`scripts/dmg/background-template.svg`** as the guide — it marks exactly where the app
and Applications icons land so you can paint a matching background (e.g. a leather‑cut texture). See
`scripts/dmg/README.md`.

> The bundled env is **arm64**, so the image targets Apple‑Silicon Macs. For a no‑warning install you'd need a
> paid **Apple Developer ID** signature + notarization (`xcrun notarytool`); without it, users do the
> one‑time bypass below.

---

## Installing the app

Because Pathstitch isn't Apple‑notarized, Gatekeeper warns on first launch. Do this **once**:

1. Open the `.dmg`, drag **Pathstitch** onto **Applications**, and double‑click it.
2. On the “…cannot be opened because Apple cannot check it…” dialog, click **Done**.
3. Go to **System Settings ▸ Privacy & Security**, scroll down, and click **Open Anyway** next to the
   Pathstitch message. Confirm with Touch ID / your password.

*(Terminal alternative, if you trust the source: `xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Pathstitch.app`.)*

**Checking your macOS version:**  ▸ About This Mac, or `sw_vers -productVersion` (needs `14.0`+).

### Automatic updates

Pathstitch updates itself with [Sparkle](https://sparkle-project.org). On the second launch it asks whether
to check for updates automatically; you can change that any time in **Pathstitch ▸ About Pathstitch** (the
**Check for Updates…** button and the **Automatically check for updates** toggle), or via
**Pathstitch ▸ Check for Updates…**. Your settings persist across updates.

**Cutting a release (maintainer):**

1. Bump `MARKETING_VERSION` *and* `CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION` (Sparkle compares the build number) in the
   Xcode target.
2. `bash scripts/package_app.sh` → `dist/Pathstitch-<version>.dmg`.
3. `bash scripts/make_appcast.sh <version>` → signs the dmg (EdDSA key in your login Keychain) and writes
   `dist/appcast.xml`.
4. `gh release create v<version> dist/Pathstitch-<version>.dmg dist/appcast.xml --title "…" --notes "…"`.

The app's feed (`SUFeedURL`) points at `releases/latest/download/appcast.xml`, so uploading the appcast as a
release asset is all it takes for existing installs to see the update. The EdDSA **public** key lives in
`Info.plist` (`SUPublicEDKey`); keep the **private** key (in your Keychain) backed up — losing it means no
future signed updates.

## Status & roadmap

Pathstitch is an actively developed **1.1**. The 2D pipeline (draw → edit → stitch → export) is the mature
core; 3D STEP import + unfolding works for developable surfaces and is expanding. Currently **Apple‑Silicon
only** — an Intel/universal build is possible by repackaging the backend on an Intel Mac.

### Native STEP preview (foxtrot)

The Finder QuickLook preview/thumbnail for `.step` files tessellates the B-rep
into a triangle mesh using [foxtrot](https://github.com/Formlabs/foxtrot)
(MIT/Apache-2.0), wrapped as a small Rust static library in
[`native/step_mesh`](native/step_mesh). A prebuilt `lib/libstep_mesh.a` is
checked in so the Xcode build needs no Rust toolchain. To rebuild it (e.g. after
bumping the foxtrot pin), install [Rust](https://rustup.rs) and run
`native/step_mesh/build.sh`.
